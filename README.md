Personal project by Kunzhi (Alex) Yu

Using classification tree models to determine when is the optimal time for tourists to visit Canadian cities. Parameters include temperature and precipitation. Working with 100 years of data from the Canadian Centre for Climate Services.

Currently, I have verified that a classification tree model is feasible and I have applied it to Toronto with a 84% accuracy.
